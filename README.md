## Tech Stack

Our platform leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies and frameworks:

- **[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: Facilitates the seamless integration of language models into application workflows, significantly enhancing AI interaction capabilities.
- **[Reflex](https://reflex.dev/)**: An open-source framework for quickly building beautiful, interactive web applications in pure Python
- **[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)**: A cross-language development platform for in-memory data that specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs.
- **[Jupyter Ai Magics](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai)**: A JupyterLab extension that provides a set of magics for working with AI models.
- **[Amundsen](https://www.amundsen.io/)**: A data discovery and metadata platform that helps users discover, understand, and trust the data they use.
- **[Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/)**: A Python data analysis framework that provides a pandas-like API for analytics on large datasets.
- **[Feast](https://feast.dev/)**: An operational feature store for managing and serving machine learning features to models in production.

## Installation
Simply install the package using pip:

```shell
pip install ryoma_ai
```
Or with extra dependencies:

```shell
pip install ryoma_ai[snowflake]
```

## Basic Example
Below is an example of using SqlAgent to connect to a postgres database and ask a question.
You can read more details in the [documentation](https://ryoma-1.gitbook.io/ryoma/).

```python
from ryoma_ai.agent.sql import SqlAgent
from ryoma_ai.datasource.postgres import PostgresDataSource

# Connect to a postgres catalog
datasource = PostgresDataSource("postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname")

# Create a SQL agent
sql_agent = SqlAgent("gpt-3.5-turbo").add_datasource(datasource)

# ask question to the agent
sql_agent.stream("I want to get the top 5 customers which making the most purchases", display=True)
```

The Sql agent will try to run the tool as shown below:
```text
================================ Human Message =================================

I want to get the top 5 customers which making the most purchases
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  sql_database_query (call_mWCPB3GQGOTLYsvp21DGlpOb)
 Call ID: call_mWCPB3GQGOTLYsvp21DGlpOb
  Args:
    query: SELECT C.C_NAME, SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS TOTAL_PURCHASES FROM CUSTOMER C JOIN ORDERS O ON C.C_CUSTKEY = O.O_CUSTKEY JOIN LINEITEM L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY GROUP BY C.C_NAME ORDER BY TOTAL_PURCHASES DESC LIMIT 5
    result_format: pandas
```
Continue to run the tool with the following code:
```python
sql_agent.stream(tool_mode=ToolMode.ONCE)
```
Output will look like after running the tool:
```text
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The top 5 customers who have made the most purchases are as follows:

1. Customer#000143500 - Total Purchases: $7,154,828.98
2. Customer#000095257 - Total Purchases: $6,645,071.02
3. Customer#000087115 - Total Purchases: $6,528,332.52
4. Customer#000134380 - Total Purchases: $6,405,556.97
5. Customer#000103834 - Total Purchases: $6,397,480.12
```

## Use Ryoma Lab
Ryoma lab is an application that allows you to interact with your data and AI models in UI.
The ryoma lab is built with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/).

1. Create Ryoma lab configuration file `rxconfig.py` in your project:
```python
import logging

import reflex as rx
from reflex.constants import LogLevel

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="ryoma_lab",
    loglevel=LogLevel.INFO,
)

# Setup basic configuration for logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```

2. You can start the ryoma lab by running the following command:
```shell
ryoma_lab run
```
the ryoma lab will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
